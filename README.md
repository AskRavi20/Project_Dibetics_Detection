# Project_Dibetics_Detection
In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with multiple hidden layers was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) in diabetes diagnosis. The model achieved 99.8% accuracy, a 0.39% improvement over existing methods, demonstrating its potential for more precise and reliable diabetes detection.
